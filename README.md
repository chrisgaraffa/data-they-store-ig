# Data They Store: Instagram
Thanks to mass pressure and legal changes, most social networks let us export the data they have on us. This tool for your Instagram export will help you understand what information they have about you - including how many times you've changed your profile or your password, where you've logged in from, what they think your interests are and more.

Of particular note, did you know that Stories aren't ephemeral? People might not be able to see them after 24 hours have gone by, but Instagram's got them.

# Instructions
(export from IG, unzip file, select the folder in the input, etc... write this)

# Privacy
This page doesn't upload any of your files to any server, anywhere. It runs completely on your computer.

# TODO
• Instructions on how to export from IG and import here  
• Parse the Unicode strings that come back from IG.
• Android, iPad, other device name and version parsing.
